to run:
 - download chromedriver, unzip, move to `/usr/local/bin` (mac os / linux)
 - `pip install selenium`
 - update info.py with the necessary info
 - once everything is ready to go, run it with 'python .\linkedin-bot.py

This program will automatically apply you to jobs on LinkedIn that has the
"Easy Apply" feature.

ATTEMPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!
Anything that happens including getting your account banned, 
I will not take any responsibility, unless it's something beneficial for me.

THIS IS STILL A BETA VERSION, WITH MANY BUGS.
I WILL DEFINITELY UPGRADE THIS SOON, SO THAT IT WILL BE ROBUST.
As far as I know, this program will work if either the job listed
is a simple, just-click-submit type, or you have applied to it before.
It cannot do more complicated ones yet, and it also can only do jobs
on the first page.

PLZ CONSIDER DONATING IF THIS HELPED YOU OR YOU THINK THIS IS COOL
OR YOU JUST FEEL LIKE IT.
